Idea behind this one is to stick bebop licks together. Puts them in the
context of an existing harmony, and puts them one after the other.

The conditions for putting one lick after another lick will at first be random.
Then you can add some "sentience" to make it more musical.

group licks in a dictionary by harmony
we'll say that all licks will be 2 beats
if a lick ends on a chord tone then any next note goes
if a lick ends half step above the chord tone of the next chord, look
for a lick that starts on that chord tone
